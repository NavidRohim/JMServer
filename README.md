# JourneyMap Waypoint Sync

*Important Notice; read bottom of this page*

This mod allows you to save waypoints on JourneyMap between multiple devices via the players account UUID on the server.

Check out the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WNXRSaEbPe)

You could think of this mod as a cloud where all your waypoints are stored, and if you join a server on another computer / device where this mod is installed on the server-side, it'll share all waypoint data like the cloud shares photos, videos, etc with all devices on that cloud.

## How to use?

Drop this mod into the the clients and servers mod folder. There is no extra setup. You will know it is working correctly if when you join a server, a message is generated at the top of the toolbar stating "Updated waypoints"

To note; this mod will **only** work in dedicated servers for now. If you start a single player world, open to LAN and another player joins your LAN game, this mod will stay disabled for the client, but in a buggy state where it still tries to update with new waypoints. You should still be able to play just fine without any crashes in this buggy state though.

## Why?

This is a personal project. I made it because I played on a server I owned on multiple devices (I played on PC, and before I went to bed I played on steam deck) but, I could never find a mod that synced JourneyMap waypoints between devices (If you know / find one, please do let me know)

This is also my first ever Java project, and publicly released programming project, so it is very likely there are bad practices. View the source code and give me feedback. There are also no guarentees I will maintain this codebase as at heart, this is still a personal project and I will do with it as I please, as long as it functions how I want it to.

I have read basic legal things about using the JourneyMap API, but if I am violating any sort of licencing. Please let me know

## Limitations

At the moment, waypoint groups arent supported.

## Version 1.0.4?

A version of JourneyMap with updated API features is required for version 1.0.4. Said version of JourneyMap has not been released. But due to the help from Mysticdrew (A JourneyMap developer) I have a build of the mod that will work with JMWS 1.0.4

Join the discord to obtain the file.

It will only be about a week (I am guessing) until the legitimate version is released on CurseForge and other platforms. As it seems, yes its very sketchy and bodged-- having to download a pre-release version of a mod. In that case, I DO NOT recommend using version 1.0.4. Use 1.0.3. For these reasons 1.0.4 is classified as a beta in Modrinth and CurseForge, but is fully functional if you have the correct version of JourneyMap.
