# JourneyMap Waypoint Syncing

This mod allows you to save waypoints on JourneyMap between multiple devices via the players account UUID on the server.

Why? This is a personal project. I made it because I played on a server I owned on multiple devices (I played on PC, and before I went to bed I played on steam deck) 
But, I could never find a mod that synced JourneyMap waypoints between devices (If you know / find one, please do let me know)

This is also my first ever Java project, and publicly released programming project, so it is very likely there are bad practices. 
View the source code and give me feedback. There are also no guarentees I will maintain this codebase as at heart, this is still a personal project and I will do with it as I please as long as it functions how I want it to.

I have read basic legal things about using the JourneyMap API, but if I am violating any sort of licencing. Please let me know

## How to use?

Drop this mod into the client and servers mod folder. There is no extra setup.
