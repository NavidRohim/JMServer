# 1.1.3 Changelog

## New

- Drag and drop support for waypoints to groups now supported.
- Server-side configuration for administration (can disable waypoints / groups for users server-wide)
- Change; added failsafe if "jmws" folder is deleted while server is running.

## Bug fixes

- Groups deleted with waypoints inside would not be moved to the Default group until next sync.
- Fixed version checking (would allow any JourneyMap jar)

## Persistent bugs

*None that I know of, either make issue or let me know on discord.*

## Future beyond v1.1.3

There is none. This mod is finished in my eyes and I have no further ideas.
If there are any bugs that are found, let me know via issue or discord and I will fix them.
If you have some sort of feature request I will do my best to fulfill it but as for me, I have no further ideas.

Thank you for anyone who has showed an interest, joined the discord or just has used the mod.
